Jibraltar
=========

Nothing to see here, move along...

Well, if you must stay, you should know that Jibraltar is simply a rough port
of [Tiddlylisp](https://github.com/mnielsen/tiddlylisp) which is in turn a
rough port of [Lis.py](http://norvig.com/lispy.html) written in (somewhat)
idiomatic [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.og/) with a hearty assist from
[ML?](http://dev.stephendiehl.com/fun/006_hindley_milner.html) with
[Optional Typing](https://github.com/clojure/core.typed).

Basically look at [Jibralter](https://github.com/rbxbx/Jibralter)
It might even work some day.
